## Objects

1. tab completion
2. command discovery:

	```
$ adb restart
Did you mean "adb reboot"?
```

3. combining common operations into single scripts
4. duplicate behavior on all connected devices. No more "more than one device found"
5. Detecting rooted devices. Some operations can't be performed on non-rooted devices. We'll detect that before running commands


## Anti-patterns

1. hacks, bodges, work arounds, or generally bad Stack Overflow answers.
